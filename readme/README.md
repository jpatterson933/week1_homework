Homework Assignment Week 1

Added semantic styling to the html document. Semantic styling was used to add a header, navigation, figure, main, sections, aside, and footer. Each semantic styling element was chosen due to what it representated on the page. (eg. aside was the right side bar of info.)

Added alt text to each of the images. Alt text was meant to describe the details of images for someone with a disability, or if the image does not load onto the screen. Each image was described in detail with its corresponding alt text. 

The three links at the stop (search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing) WHEN CLICKED take the user to the corresponding element on the web page. (eg. when I click search engine optimization, the page takes me down to teh section search engine optimization). On that note, I needed to add the id="search-engine-optimization" to the first section in main so the links on the web page would function properly.

Reformated about 80% of the CSS to match the semantic style layout of the html to make it easier to find, view, and edit between the index.html and style.css files.

I ran into the problem when I did my final push, my github webpage was displaying my readme file instead of the website. Once I resturucted my files and did a push, the website appeared.

I would like to know a bit more about file structure and pushing in general. Perhaps file strcuture overview. Basically, I does it matter where my html files are, or style file is? I was a bit confused. Can html docs be in folders and still display on the website correctly or does it have to be outside of any single repository/folder?
